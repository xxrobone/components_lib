This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, clone the repo, fork it or download it:
Second, open the project in your favorite editor, I like vs code :D

```bash
npm i
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can see all the components in the `app/components` folder. 

## More info coming soon...
